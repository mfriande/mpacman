1) Design the Game Structure:

Identify the main components of your game, such as Pacman, ghosts, pellets, and the maze.

2) Set Up the Development Environment:

Choose a C compiler and set up your development environment. You might want to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or any other that you prefer.

3) Define Game Entities:

Create structures or classes to represent game entities like Pacman, ghosts, pellets, and the maze. Define their properties and behaviors.

4) Draw the Game Board:

Use ASCII characters or graphics libraries to draw the game board and maze. Represent walls, pellets, and other elements.

5) Handle User Input:

Implement code to handle user input for controlling Pacman's movement.

6) Update Game State:

Implement game logic to update the position and state of entities (Pacman, ghosts) based on user input and game rules.

7) Collision Detection:

Check for collisions between Pacman and other entities. For example, when Pacman eats a pellet or encounters a ghost.

8) Implement Ghost Behavior:

Define the behavior of ghosts. They could follow a simple predefined path or exhibit more complex AI behavior.

9) Scorekeeping:

Implement a scoring system to keep track of points as Pacman eats pellets and interacts with ghosts.

10) Game Over and Win Conditions:

Implement conditions for the game to end, either when Pacman is caught by a ghost or when all pellets are consumed.

11) Display:

Use libraries or console output to display the updated game state.

12) Game Loop:

Create a game loop to continuously update the game state, handle input, and refresh the display.

13) Testing:

Regularly test your game to identify and fix bugs or unintended behavior.
